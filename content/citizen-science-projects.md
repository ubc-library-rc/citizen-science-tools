# Citizen Science projects
Citizen Science projects can range in scope from many people working across many areas to a few people focused on one small thing. Before joining a project make sure to read through contributor guidelines carefully, most Citizen Science projects put effort into helping contributors be empowered Citizen Scientists. Always make sure to reflect on the level of commitment you are able or willing to take on and whether you are comfortable with the data privacy policy of a given project. 

If you are creating accounts on many different tools or downloading unknown apps, please consider the following best practices to protect your identity and minimise your risk.

## An incomplete list of projects to explore

The projects below showcase the diversity of Citizen Science projects.

[AgeGuess](https://www.ageguess.org/)

"A citizen science project on human biological and chronological age."

[eBird Canada](https://ebird.org/canada/home)

Birdwatching with purpose. "Your sightings contribute to hundreds of conservation decisions and peer-reviewed papers, thousands of student projects, and help inform bird research worldwide."

[FISHstory](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/safmcadmin/fishstory)

"Filling Fisheries Data Gaps with Historical Dock Photos."

[Fossil Atmospheres](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/laurasoul/fossil-atmospheres)

"Count cells of modern & fossil leaves. Help us track climate change over millions of years"

[Gravity Spy](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy)

"Help scientists at LIGO() search for gravitational waves, the elusive ripples of spacetime"

[Penguin Watch](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch)

"Count penguins in remote regions to help us understand their lives and environment."

[The Reef Life Survey](https://reeflifesurvey.com/about-rls/)

"Reef Life Survey is a non-profit citizen science program in which trained SCUBA divers undertake standardised underwater visual surveys of reef biodiversity on rocky and coral reefs around the world."

[SETI@home](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/sah_about.php)

One of the earliest Citizen Science projects to leverage wide availability of personal computers was "SETI@home". SETI stands for the "Search for Extra Terrestrial Life" and asked citizen scientists to download software that would make use of their internet-connected computers while they were not in use to scan the skies for signs of alien life. This project is currently in hibernation.

[The SkyNet](https://www.icrar.org/outreach-education/outreach-initiatives/the-skynet/)

"...a citizen science project that aims to raise the public profile of science and radio astronomy while simultaneously creating a research grade data processing resource for scientists."
